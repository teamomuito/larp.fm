larp.fm picks up whatever's playing on your phone (Spotify, YouTube Music, Poweramp, pretty much
any app with a media notification) and scrobbles it to [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm). No
internet? Plays get saved and sent later.

And yes, it larps. Pause and resume a song, skip back or seek, and it counts again.

## features

- scrobble after anywhere from 1% to 50% of a song (Last.fm's default is 50%)
- send the album, or just artist + track
- clean up album titles: `Iron Maiden (Remaster) [Special]` becomes `Iron Maiden`
- scrobble just the first artist: `Artist A feat. Artist B` becomes `Artist A`
- LARP: songs scrobble again every time you pause and resume, skip back or seek
- choose which apps get scrobbled
- pink, obviously

## install

1. Download **[larpfm.apk](https://github.com/teamomuito/larp.fm/releases/latest/download/larpfm.apk)**.
   That link always points to the newest build, and older ones are on the
   [releases page](https://github.com/teamomuito/larp.fm/releases).
2. Install the APK. Your phone will ask you to allow installs from your browser or files app.
3. Tap **Sign in with Last.fm**, hit Allow on the Last.fm page, and you're back in the app. If
   the build doesn't have an API key baked in, it'll ask for one first.
   [Grab one here](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create). It takes a minute, and the name and
   description can be anything.
4. Give it notification access when it asks. That's the only way Android lets an app see what's
   playing. larp.fm doesn't read your notifications.

> [!TIP]
> On Android 13+, if the notification access switch is greyed out, go to
> **App info → ⋮ → Allow restricted settings** and try again. Android does this to every app
> that doesn't come from the Play Store.

Updating? Uninstall the old version first, or Android won't install the new one over it.

## about LARP

Once a song has scrobbled, pausing and resuming it, skipping back to the start, looping it on
repeat-one or dragging the progress bar starts a new play. That play scrobbles again once it
passes the threshold, with its own timestamp so Last.fm doesn't throw it out as a duplicate. Turn
it off with **Rescrobble on skip & pause** in the settings.

Last.fm isn't a fan of fake scrobbles, so larp responsibly.

<summary><b>building it yourself</b></summary>
<br>

You'll need JDK 17 and the Android SDK.

```sh
./gradlew test assembleRelease
```

The APK ends up in `app/build/outputs/apk/release/`. GitHub Actions builds every push, and
each push to the main branch is published as a release (the 5 newest are kept).

These repo secrets are optional:

| secret | what it's for |
| --- | --- |
| `LASTFM_API_KEY`, `LASTFM_API_SECRET` | bakes an API key into the app so nobody has to paste one |
| `SIGNING_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `SIGNING_STORE_PASSWORD`, `SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS`, `SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD` | signs every build with the same key, so updates install over the old version |

To make a keystore:

```sh
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore release.keystore -alias larpfm -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000
base64 -w0 release.keystore
```

The code is split in two:

- `core/` is plain Kotlin with unit tests. It has the scrobble rules, the playback tracking, the
  album title cleanup and the Last.fm client.
- `app/` is the Android app. It uses Jetpack Compose for the UI, a notification listener that
  follows media sessions, and WorkManager to send scrobbles.
